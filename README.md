# RIMeta: Estimate the Reference Interval from a Meta-Analysis

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/RIMeta](https://shinyappstore.com/a/RIMeta)__

RIMeta is a user-friendly and robust application designed for meta-analysis, specifically focusing on estimating pooled mean and reference intervals. It offers two meta-analysis models: the random effects model and the fixed effects model. The random effects model considers both between-study and within-study variations, while the fixed effects model assumes independent study means, typically preferred with a small number of studies. RIMeta provides multiple methods for estimating the reference interval. For the fixed effects model, it implements the mixture distribution method proposed by Cao et al. This method assumes the pooled population is representative of the overall population, allowing each study to have any distribution determined by mean and variance. While it doesn't restrict the distribution type for each study, RIMeta treats them as normally distributed for simplicity. Overall, RIMeta stands out as a powerful tool.
